Hough transform is a feature extraction technique used in computer vision, and digital image processing. The main advantage of Hough transform is its capability to detect shape of the objects, even if they are occluded. According to "Image processing, analysis, and machine vision, 2014", Hough Transform usually consists of the following steps:
1. Preprocessing input images.
2. Detect edge using some filters.
3. Construct a look-up table for circles, construct and update accumulator.
4. Select possible circiles from accumulator.
5. Mark and display the result.

In this project, we are given an image with conis of different size(few are overlaped). The task is to detect and display circiels around the boundary of the coins.
